# Migration to windows
## OS
- Mint looks a bit to ald and non-windows. Tested on VM.
- Solus is a good option, but may need a little configuring. Tested on vm.
- **Zorin** is an option, seems to work reasonably well. This is very polished, prob best option currently. A possiblilty for me even. **Very** user friendly. Zorin 17 is using jammy 22.04 apt repo. Zorin 18 may be released q3/4 2025. Zorin does offer paid versions, but that appears to be for pre-installed professional software and more desktop layouts, prob not needed. Should move onto live image testing, prob on sd card. 
- Pop!_OS. Could be configured to be more tolderable, depends if the dock can be aligned to the bottom left like on windows.

## Software
- https://github.com/winapps-org/winapps appears to support ms office and other utility programs.
