# Migration to windows
## OS
- Mint looks a bit to ald and non-windows. Tested on VM.
- Solus is a good option, but may need a little configuring. Tested on vm.
- Pop!_OS. Could be configured to be more tolderable, depends if the dock can be aligned to the bottom left like on windows.

## Software
- https://github.com/winapps-org/winapps appears to support ms office and other utility programs.
